Analyze photo (tif file format)
I have received a TIFF file through a satellite which depicts Azerbaijan. Due to its large size, I have uploaded it to Google Drive. You can easily download the file from there. Additionally, we possess specific shape files that represent distinct regions within Azerbaijan, including one shape file intended for our assignment. While the other files in the folder are not necessary, having them within the same directory as the download path can help us prevent errors. This approach enables us to identify viable areas for crop cultivation in the Bilasuvar district. The insights gained from this information can be applied to various projects. Towards the end of the code, I have constructed an interactive map that provides instances of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values suitable for planting within vegetated areas in those aforementioned regions.
